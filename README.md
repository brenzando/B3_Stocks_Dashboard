## Usage Guide

### 1. Analyze a Single Stock

1. Select a stock ticker from the **Stock Ticker** dropdown in the left panel
2. Choose a time period using the **Period** pills (1mo, 3mo, 6mo, 1y, etc.)
3. View real-time metrics in the top section:
   - Last Price and Daily Change
   - Open Price, Day High, Day Low
   - Previous Close Price
4. Explore the **About** section for company information
5. Review statistical metrics including:
   - Cumulative Return
   - Annualized Volatility
   - Average and Median Prices
   - Coefficient of Variation
6. Analyze the price chart to visualize historical trends

### 2. Compare Multiple Stocks

1. Scroll down to the **Statistical Analyses** section
2. Select a time period for comparison
3. Choose **at least two stocks** from the multiselect box
4. View automatically generated analyses:
   - **Cumulative Returns Chart**: Track return trends over time
   - **Correlation Heatmap**: Identify relationships between stocks (1.0 = perfect correlation, -1.0 = inverse correlation, 0 = no correlation)
   - **Returns Ranking**: Bar chart showing cumulative returns ranked
   - **Volatility Metrics**: Compare annualized volatility across stocks
   - **Coefficient Variation**: Identify stocks with stable vs. volatile prices

### 3. Interpret Key Metrics

- **Cumulative Return**: Total percentage gain/loss over the period
- **Annualized Volatility**: Standard deviation of returns scaled to 1 year (252 trading days)
- **Coefficient of Variation**: Risk per unit of return (lower = more stable)
- **Correlation**: Relationship between stock price movements
  - Close to 1: Stocks move together
  - Close to -1: Stocks move in opposite directions
  - Close to 0: No linear relationship

## Performance Optimization

The application implements Streamlit's `@st.cache_data` decorator for data functions to:
- Reduce API calls to yfinance
- Improve dashboard responsiveness
- Cache historical data between reruns

---

## Data Source

- **Primary Source**: [yfinance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) - Yahoo Finance API
- **Market**: B3 (Brasil, Bolsa, Balcão)
- **Data Type**: Historical OHLCV prices and current quotes
- **Update Frequency**: Real-time (subject to market hours and data provider updates)

---

## Limitations

1. **Market Hours**: Historical data updates occur during B3 trading hours
2. **Delisted Stocks**: Stocks that have been delisted may return incomplete data
3. **API Rate Limiting**: Yahoo Finance has rate limits; excessive requests may result in temporary blocks
4. **Historical Data**: Complete historical data availability varies by stock (typically 10+ years)

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **"Please select at least two stocks for analysis"** | Select 2 or more stocks in the multiselect box for comparative analysis |
| **Missing price data** | Some stocks may have gaps in historical data; try a different period or stock |
| **Slow dashboard loading** | Clear Streamlit cache: Press `C` in the app or restart with `streamlit run --logger.level=debug streamlit_app.py` |
| **Connection errors** | Check internet connection and verify yfinance API availability |
| **Stock not found** | Ensure the ticker includes `.SA` suffix (e.g., 'PETR4.SA' not 'PETR4') |

---
